# SSVM Bugfix

This is a fork of the original repository, because the owner has left it in a largely nonfunctioning state.

Here's a list of the changes I've made:
- Small script and config fixes for specific npcs
- Edge case fixes involving entities despawning
- Removed dangling references to an npc who was previously removed at their owner's request
- Updated a certain patch to be able to coexist with other mods that patch the same config

I am only maintaining this mod so that the old content it contains remains available in the future. I will not provide any content updates for this mod. It is very old, and does not belong to me. You can get more content for this mod by finding various addons people have made elsewhere on the internet.  
If you want something newer that receives regular updates, you should check out [Starbecue](https://github.com/WasabiRaptor/Starbecue), another starbound vore mod focusing more on npc interactions instead of furniture objects.  
SSVM *should* fully be able to coexist with Starbecue, though we don't test to make sure very often because this mod increases load times considerably. Please let me know if there's anything else in this mod that needs fixing!

## Installing the mod

- Click the big green "Code" button at the top
- Click "Download Zip" in the menu that pops up.
- Unzip the zip you just downloaded
- Drag everything from inside the mods folder in the zip, into the mods folder in your starbound folder
  - If you need help finding your starbound folder: just right click on the game in steam, and browse local files
